# OIBSIP Data Analytics Task 5 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective
To build a machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict house prices based on relevant features.
## Dataset
Housing.csv
## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Collection
- Loaded housing dataset

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Removed invalid entries

### 3. Feature Selection
- Selected relevant features affecting price

### 4. Train-Test Split
- Split dataset into training and testing sets

### 5. Model Training
- Applied Linear Regression model

### 6. Model Evaluation
